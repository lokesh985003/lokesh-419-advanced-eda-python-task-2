# Advance (EDA) Python Programming – Task 2

## Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship

This repository contains solutions to six Python programming problems.  
These problems help to understand basic Python logic such as strings, lists, loops, counting, and XOR operations.  
All programs are written in a simple and clear way.

## Problem Details

### 1. Defanging an IP Address
**File:** `1_defanging_ip_address.py`

This program replaces every `.` in an IP address with `[.]`.

Example:  
Input: 1.1.1.1
Output: 1[.]1[.]1[.]1

yaml
Copy code

### 2. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
**File:** `2_even_digits.py`

This program counts how many numbers have an even number of digits in a list.

Example:
Input: [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]
Output: 2

yaml
Copy code

---

### 3. Number of Good Pairs
**File:** `3_good_pairs.py`

This program counts how many pairs have the same value and different positions.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]
Output: 4

yaml
Copy code

---

### 4. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
**File:** `4_smaller_numbers.py`

For each number, this program finds how many numbers are smaller than it.

Example:
Input: [8, 1, 2, 2, 3]
Output: [4, 0, 1, 1, 3]

yaml
Copy code

---

### 5. Subtract Product and Sum of Digits
**File:** `5_subtract_product_sum.py`

This program finds the product of digits and the sum of digits, then subtracts them.

Example:
Input: 234
Output: 15

yaml
Copy code

---

### 6. XOR Operation in an Array
**File:** `6_xor_operation.py`

This program creates numbers using a rule and applies XOR on all values.

Example:
Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8

yaml
