🧾 Problem Descriptions
1️⃣ Defanging an IP Address (1_defanging_ip_address.py)

Replaces every "." with "[.]" in an IP address string

Demonstrates string replacement and manipulation

2️⃣ Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits (2_even_digits.py)

Counts how many integers in a list contain an even number of digits

Uses type conversion and length checking

3️⃣ Number of Good Pairs (3_good_pairs.py)

Counts pairs (i, j) such that:

nums[i] == nums[j]

i < j

Demonstrates nested loops and comparison logic

4️⃣ How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number (4_smaller_numbers.py)

For each element, counts how many elements are smaller than it

Reinforces nested iteration and list construction

5️⃣ Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits (5_subtract_product_sum.py)

Computes:
product of digits − sum of digits

Demonstrates digit extraction and numeric operations

6️⃣ XOR Operation in an Array (6_xor_operation.py)

Generates values using start + 2*i

Applies cumulative bitwise XOR

Demonstrates bitwise operators and loops

🛠 Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

Python 3.x

Loops and conditional logic

String and numeric processing

Bitwise XOR operations

Clean function-based logic

Problem-solving (LeetCode style)

Git & GitHub usage
