# 🚀 Advance (EDA) Python Programming – Programming Task 2

## Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship

This repository contains solutions to six Python programming problems completed as part of the **Advance (EDA) Python Programming** task.  
These tasks focus on **core and applied Python concepts** such as string processing, list operations, loops, counting logic, and bitwise XOR operations.  
All problems are solved using clear logic and structured code.

## 🧾 Problem Descriptions

### 1️⃣ Defanging an IP Address — `1_defanging_ip_address.py`
This program replaces every dot `.` in an IP address with `[.]`.

Purpose:
- Practice string processing and replacement logic

---

### 2️⃣ Find Numbers With Even Number of Digits — `2_even_digits.py`
This program counts how many numbers in a list have an even number of digits.

Purpose:
- Practice loops and digit counting logic

---

### 3️⃣ Number of Good Pairs — `3_good_pairs.py`
This program counts pairs `(i, j)` such that the values are equal and `i < j`.

Purpose:
- Understand nested loops and comparison logic

---

### 4️⃣ How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number — `4_smaller_numbers.py`
For each number in the list, this program finds how many numbers are smaller than it.

Purpose:
- Improve comparison techniques and nested iteration

---

### 5️⃣ Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits — `5_subtract_product_sum.py`
This program calculates the product of digits and the sum of digits, then subtracts them.

Purpose:
- Practice number processing and arithmetic logic

---

### 6️⃣ XOR Operation in an Array — `6_xor_operation.py`
This program generates numbers using the rule `start + 2*i` and applies XOR to all values.

Purpose:
- Understand bitwise XOR and loop-based logic

---
